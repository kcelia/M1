<h2 id="sec:tabling"><a name="sec:A.35"><span class="sec-nr">A.35</span> <span class="sec-title">library(tabling): 
Tabled execution (SLG)</span></a></h2>

<a name="sec:tabling"></a>

<p><a name="idx:SLGresolution:2171"></a>The library <code>library(tabling)</code> 
provides support for <em>Tabled execution</em> of one or more Prolog 
predicates, also called <em>SLG resolution</em>. Tabling a predicate 
provides two properties:

<p>
<ol class="latex">
<li>Re-evaluation of a tabled predicate is avoided by
<em>memoizing</em> the answers. This can realise huge performance 
enhancements as illustrated in
<a class="sec" href="tabling.html">section A.35.1</a>. It also comes 
with two downsides: the memoized answers are not automatically updated 
or invalidated if the world (set of predicates on which the answers 
depend) changes and the answer tables must be stored (in memory).

<p>
<li><em>Left recursion</em>, a goal calling a <em>variant</em> of itself 
recursively and thus <i>looping</i> under the normal Prolog SLD 
resolution is avoided by suspending the variant call and resuming it 
with answers from the table. This is illustrated in <a class="sec" href="tabling.html">section 
A.35.2</a>.
</ol>

<p>Tabling is particularly suited to simplify inference over a highly 
entangled set of predicates that express axioms and rules in a static 
(not changing) world. When using SLD resolution for such problems, it is 
hard to ensure termination and avoid frequent recomputation of 
intermediate results. A solution is to use Datalog style bottom-up 
evaluation, i.e., applying rules on the axioms and derived facts until a 
fixed point is reached. However, bottom-up evaluation typically derives 
many facts that are never used. Tabling provides a <em>goal oriented</em> 
resolution strategy for such problems and is enabled simply by adding a <a name="idx:table1:2172"></a><a class="pred" href="tabling.html#table/1">table/1</a> 
directive to the program.

<p><h4 id="sec:tabling-memoize"><a name="sec:A.35.1"><span class="sec-nr">A.35.1</span> <span class="sec-title">Example 
1: using tabling for memoizing</span></a></h4>

<a name="sec:tabling-memoize"></a>

<p>As a first classical example we use tabling for <em>memoizing</em> 
intermediate results. We use Fibonacci numbers to illustrate the 
approach. The Fibonacci number <var>I</var> is defined as the sum of the 
Fibonacci numbers for <var>I-1</var> and <var>I-2</var>, while the 
Fibonacci number of 0 and 1 are both defined to be 1. This can be 
translated naturally into Prolog:

<pre class="code">
fib(0, 1) :- !.
fib(1, 1) :- !.
fib(N, F) :-
        N &gt; 1,
        N1 is N-1,
        N2 is N-2,
        fib(N1, F1),
        fib(N2, F2),
        F is F1+F2.
</pre>

<p>The complexity of executing this using SLD resolution however is <var>2^N</var> 
and thus becomes prohibitively slow rather quickly, e.g., the execution 
time for <var>N=30</var> is already 0.4 seconds. Using tabling, <code>fib(N,F)</code> 
for each value of <var>N</var> is computed only once and the algorithm 
becomes linear. Tabling effectively inverts the execution order for this 
case: it suspends the final addition (F is F1+F2) until the two 
preceeding Fibonacci numbers have been added to the answer tables. Thus, 
we can reduce the complexity from the show-stopping <var>2^N</var> to 
linear by adding a tabling directive and otherwise not changing the 
algorithm. The code becomes:

<pre class="code">
:- use_module(library(tabling)).
:- table fib/2.

fib(0, 1) :- !.
fib(1, 1) :- !.
fib(N, F) :-
        N &gt; 1,
        N1 is N-1,
        N2 is N-2,
        fib(N1, F1),
        fib(N2, F2),
        F is F1+F2.
</pre>

<p>The price that we pay is that a table <code>fib(I,F)</code> is 
created for each <var>I</var> in <var>0..N</var>. The execution time for <var>N=30</var> 
is now 1 millisecond and computing the Fibonacci number for <var>N=1000</var> 
is doable (output edited for readability).

<pre class="code">
1 ?- time(fib(1000, X)).
% 52,991 inferences, 0.013 CPU in 0.013 seconds
X = 70330367711422815821835254877183549770181269836358
    73274260490508715453711819693357974224949456261173
    34877504492417659910881863632654502236471060120533
    74121273867339111198139373125598767690091902245245
    323403501.
</pre>

<p>In the case of Fibonacci numbers we can still rather easily achieve 
linear complexity using program transformation, where we use bottom-up 
instead of top-down evaluation, i.e., we compute <code>fib(N,F)</code> 
for growing <var>N</var>, where we pass the last two Fibonacci numbers 
to the next iteration. Not having to create the tables and not having to 
suspend and resume goals makes this implementation about 25 times faster 
than the tabled one. However, even in this simple case the 
transformation is not obvious and it is far more difficult to recognise 
the algorithm as an implementation of Fibonacci numbers.

<pre class="code">
fib(0, 1) :- !.
fib(1, 1) :- !.
fib(N, F) :-
        fib(1,1,1,N,F).

fib(_F, F1, N, N, F1) :- !.
fib(F0, F1, I, N, F) :-
        F2 is F0+F1,
        I2 is I + 1,
        fib(F1, F2, I2, N, F).
</pre>

<p><h4 id="sec:tabling-non-termination"><a name="sec:A.35.2"><span class="sec-nr">A.35.2</span> <span class="sec-title">Example 
2: avoiding non-termination</span></a></h4>

<a name="sec:tabling-non-termination"></a>

<p>SLD resolution easily results in an infinite loop due to <em>left 
recursion</em>, a goal that (indirectly) calls a variant of itself or 
cycles in the input data. Thus, if we have a series of connection/2 
statements that define railway connections between two cities, we cannot 
use the most natural logical definition to express that we can travel 
between two cities:

<pre class="code">
% :- use_module(library(tabling)).
% :- table connection/2.

connection(X, Y) :-
        connection(X, Z),
        connection(Z, Y).
connection(X, Y) :-
        connection(Y, X).

connection('Amsterdam', 'Schiphol').
connection('Amsterdam', 'Haarlem').
connection('Schiphol', 'Leiden').
connection('Haarlem', 'Leiden').
</pre>

<p>After enabling tabling however, the above works just fine as 
illustrated in the session below. Where is the magic and what is the 
price we paid? The magic is, again, the fact that new goals to the 
tabled predicate suspend. So, all recursive goals are suspended. 
Eventually, a table for <code>connection('Amsterdam', X)</code> is 
created with the two direct connections from Amsterdam. Now, it resumes 
the first clause using the tabled solutions, continuing the last 
connection/2 subgoal with <code>connection('Schiphol', X)</code> and <code>connection('Haarlem', 
X)</code>. These two go through the same process, creating new suspended 
recursive calls and creating tables for the connections from Schiphol 
and Haarlem. Eventually, we end up with a set of tables for each call 
variant that is involved in computing the transitive closure of the 
network starting in Amsterdam. However, if the Japanese rail network 
would have been in our data as well, we would not have produced tables 
for that.

<pre class="code">
1 ?- connection('Amsterdam', X).
X = 'Haarlem' ;
X = 'Schiphol' ;
X = 'Amsterdam' ;
X = 'Leiden'.
</pre>

<p>Again, the fact that a simple <a name="idx:table1:2173"></a><a class="pred" href="tabling.html#table/1">table/1</a> 
directive turns the pure logical specification into a fairly efficient 
algorithm is a clear advantage. Without tabling the program needs to be <em>stratified</em>, 
introducing a base layer with the raw connections, a second layer that 
introduces the <em>commutative</em> property of a railway (if you can 
travel from
<var>A</var> to <var>B</var> you can also travel from <var>B</var> to <var>A</var> 
and a final layer that realises <em>transitivity</em> (if you can travel 
from <var>A</var> to <var>B</var> and from <var>B</var> to <var>C</var> 
you can also travel from <var>A</var> to <var>C</var>). The third and 
final layer must keep track which cities you have already visited to 
avoid traveling in circles. The transformed program however uses little 
memory (the list of already visited cities and the still open choices) 
and does not need to deal with maintaining consistency between the 
tables and ground facts.

<p><h4 id="sec:tabling-mode-directed"><a name="sec:A.35.3"><span class="sec-nr">A.35.3</span> <span class="sec-title">Mode 
directed tabling</span></a></h4>

<a name="sec:tabling-mode-directed"></a>

<p><a name="idx:answersubsumptiontabling:2174"></a>Tabling as defined 
above has a serious limitation. Although the definition of connection/2 
from section
<a class="sec" href="tabling.html">section A.35.2</a> can compute the 
transitive closure of connected cities, it cannot provide you with a 
route to travel. The reason is that there are infinitely many routes if 
there are cycles in the network and each new route found will be added 
to the answer table and cause the tabled execution's completion 
algorithm to search for more routes, eventually running out of memory.

<p>The solution to this problem is called <em>mode directed tabling</em> 
or
<em>answer subsumption</em>.<sup class="fn">183<span class="fn-text">The 
term <em>answer subsumption</em> is used by XSB and <em>mode directed 
tabling</em> by YAP and B-Prolog. The idea is that some arguments are 
considered `outputs', where multiple values for the same `input' are 
combined. Possibly <em>answer aggregation</em> would have been a better 
name.</span></sup> In this execution model one or more arguments are <em>not</em> 
added to the table. Instead, we remember a single <em>aggregated</em> 
value for these arguments. The example below is derived from
<a class="sec" href="tabling.html">section A.35.2</a> and returns the 
connection as a list of cities. This argument is defined as a <em>moded</em> 
argument using the
<code>lattice(PI)</code> mode.<sup class="fn">184<span class="fn-text">This 
mode is compatible to XSB Prolog.</span></sup> This causes the tabling 
engine each time that it finds an new path to call shortest/3 and keep 
the shortest route.

<pre class="code">
:- use_module(library(tabling)).
:- table
    connection(_,_,lattice(shortest/3)).

shortest(P1, P2, P):-
    length(P1, L1),
    length(P2, L2),
    (   L1 &lt; L2
    -&gt;  P = P1
    ;   P = P2
    ).

connection(X, Y, [X,Y]) :-
    connection(X, Y).
connection(X, Y, P) :-
    connection(X, Z, P0),
    connection(Z, Y),
    append(P0, [Y], P).
</pre>

<p>The mode declation scheme is equivalent to XSB with partial 
compatibility support for YAP and B-Prolog. The <code>lattice(PI)</code> 
mode is the most general mode. The YAP <code>all</code> (B-Prolog <code>@</code>) 
mode is not yet supported. The list below describes the supported modes 
and indicates the portability.

the tabling implementation</span></a></h4>

<a name="sec:tabling-about"></a>

<p>The SWI-Prolog implementation uses <em>Delimited continuations</em> 
(see
<a class="sec" href="delcont.html">section 4.10</a> to realise 
suspension of variant calls. The initial version was written by Benoit 
Desouter and described in
<cite><a class="cite" href="Bibliography.html#DBLP:journals/tplp/DesouterDS15">Desouter <em>et 
al.</em>, 2015</a></cite>. We moved the main data structures required 
for tabling, the <em>answer tables</em> (see
<a class="sec" href="db.html">section 4.14.4</a>) and the <em>worklist</em> 
to SWI-Prolog's C&nbsp;core.
<em>Mode directed tabling</em> (<a class="sec" href="tabling.html">section 
A.35.3</a>) is based on a prototype implementation by Fabrizio Riguzzi.

<p>The <a name="idx:table1:2175"></a><a class="pred" href="tabling.html#table/1">table/1</a> 
directive causes the creation of a wrapper calling the renamed original 
predicate. For example, the program in
<a class="sec" href="tabling.html">section A.35.2</a> is translated into 
the following program. We give this information to improve your 
understanding of the current tabling implementation. Future versions are 
likely to use a more low-level translation that is not based on 
wrappers.

<pre class="code">
connection(A, B) :-
        start_tabling(user:connection(A, B),
                      'connection tabled'(A, B)).

'connection tabled'(X, Y) :-
        connection(X, Z),
        connection(Z, Y).
'connection tabled'(X, Y) :-
        connection(Y, X).

'connection tabled'('Amsterdam', 'Schiphol').

of tabling</span></a></h4>

<a name="sec:tabling-status"></a>

<p>The current implementation is merely a first prototype. It needs 
several enhancements before we can consider it a serious competitor to 
Prolog systems with mature tabling such as XSB, YAP and B-Prolog. In 
particular,

<p>
<ul class="compact">
<li>The performance needs to be improved.
<li>Memory usage needs to be reduced.
<li>Tables must be shared between threads, both to reduce space and 
avoid recomputation.
<li>Tables must be invalidated and reclaimed automatically.
<li>Notably XSB supports incremental tabeling and well-founded semantics 
under negation.
</ul>
