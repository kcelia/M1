---+ SWI-Prolog HTTP support library

This directory provides  the  SWI-Prolog   libraries  for  accessing and
providing HTTP services.  The client libraries come in two forms:

    * The lightweight http_open.pl opens an HTTP location as a stream
    * The more full-blown http_client.pl performs arbitrary HTTP
    requests and, depending on loaded plugins, transforms the data
    in a Prolog-friendly format.

The primary server-library  is   thread_httpd.pl,  providing  full-blown
scalable embedded HTTP server.
